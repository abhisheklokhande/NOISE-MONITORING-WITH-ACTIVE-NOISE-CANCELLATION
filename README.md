# NOISE-MONITORING-WITH-ACTIVE-NOISE-CANCELLATION
#### NOISE-STRESS 
WE HAVE AN ANDROID APPLICATION OF NOISE DECIBELS TO RECOGNISE THE SOUND AND GIVES THE OUTPUT IN DECIBELS.<BR/>
#### ANC HEADPHONES. 
IN THIS PROJECT WE DONT USE THE ANC HEADPHONES. INSTEAD OF THAT WE ARE USING RASPBERRY PI WITH MICROPHONE AND SPEAKER.
SO IN THIS RASPBERRY PI WE ARE INSERTING THE CODE OF LMS ALGORITHM AND ADAPTIVE FILTERS SO THAT THE RASPBERRY PI RECOGNISE 
THE SOUND FROM MICROPHONE AND THROUGH THE LMS ALGORITHM AND ADAPTIVE FILTERS IT WILL CANCEL THE NOISE.
#### CLOUD PART
THE RASBERRY PI WE CONNECT THROUGH NODE-RED AND WE CREATED A FLOW THAT WILL GONNA CONNECT TO IBM WATSON IOT FOR THE OUTPUT OF
THE NOISE MONITORING.WE USE SOME FUCTIONS TO CALL THE RASPBERRY PI TO CONNECT IT WITH IBM WATSON IOT.
